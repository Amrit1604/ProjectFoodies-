          <p class="faq-heading"> HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT TO LEARN?</p>
          <div class='faq-arrow'></div>
            <p class="faq-text">The most important thing is that you want to learn something that interests you, because once you start learning, you'll be with this topic for a while.</p>

          <p class="faq-heading"> WHICH PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS THE BEST TO LEARN?</p>
          <div class='faq-arrow'></div>
         <p class="faq-text">I usually tell most people to start by learning HTML and CSS, then move into learning JavaScript. The reason is that JavaScript is used everywhere: frontend, backend, and even to build mobile apps. It has many use cases, which is why I think it's smart to learn.</p>

          <p class="faq-heading">IS IT POSSIBLE TO DO BOTH GRAPHIC DESIGN AND CODING?</p>
          <div class='faq-arrow'></div>
            <p class="faq-text">If you have an interest in coding and graphic design, then there's nothing to say you shouldn't learn skills in both areas. They often work hand-in-hand, so having knowledge and skills in both areas could be desirable for certain career paths.</p>

          <p class="faq-heading"> SHOULD I LEARN SKILLS IN SEVERAL AREAS, OR FOCUS ON ONE THING IN PARTICULAR?</p>
          <div class='faq-arrow'></div>
            <p class="faq-text">Personally, I'd say choose a path and stick to it! Learning too many things at once will slow you down. Here are a few ideas of things you can choose to focus on, and a little bit about each one.Example-Data Science,Data Analysis,Ruby on Rails,UX etc.</p>

          <div class='faq-arrow'></div>
            <p class="faq-text">To be a good programmer, there are no shortcuts. That is not the right way to think about it.<br>
                Instead, you should take time mastering the fundamentals. This will help you in the long run.</p>

          <div class='faq-arrow'></div>
            <p class="faq-text">Remember everyone has to start somewhere. Oftentimes, people can be very hard on themselves when starting to learn anything new, especially coding. Just know that everyone has been in the same boat at some point, and you're not alone.</p>

          <div class='faq-arrow'></div>
            <p class="faq-text">Learning to code can be quite a lonely thing if you're doing it on your own, and if you don't have someone there for pep talks, your confidence might fall. We've all experienced moments of doubts, and that's OK.</p>

            <p class="faq-text">You don't have to stop learning when you finish college!
